# ‚ö° Angular Compilation: JIT vs AOT

## üîπ Simple Definition

* **JIT (Just-in-Time) Compilation**:

  * Angular **compiles your app in the browser at runtime**.
  * Templates and components are compiled **when the app runs**.

* **AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compilation**:

  * Angular **compiles your app during build time**.
  * Templates and components are compiled **before the browser loads the app**.

## üîπ Key Points

| Feature                  | JIT Compilation                   | AOT Compilation                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| When compilation happens | In the browser (runtime)          | During build (before deployment) |
| Build time               | Fast build, slower runtime        | Slower build, faster runtime     |
| Error detection          | Errors shown only at runtime      | Errors detected at compile-time  |
| Bundle size              | Larger (templates included in JS) | Smaller (templates pre-compiled) |
| Security                 | Vulnerable to injection attacks   | Safer, templates pre-compiled    |
| Startup time             | Slower (browser compiles)         | Faster (pre-compiled JS)         |
| Production usage         | ‚ùå Not recommended                 | ‚úÖ Recommended                    |

## üîπ When to Use

* **JIT**

  * During **development** ‚Üí faster rebuild, easier debugging.
  * Run with `ng serve` (default in dev).

* **AOT**

  * During **production deployment** ‚Üí faster startup, smaller bundle, more secure.
  * Run with `ng build --prod` or Angular 13+: `ng build` (AOT is default).

---

## üîπ How They Work

### JIT Flow

```
Source Code + Templates
         |
         v
Browser compiles templates and components
         |
         v
App runs with compiled code
```

### AOT Flow

```
Source Code + Templates
         |
         v
Angular compiler compiles templates & components at build
         |
         v
Precompiled JavaScript bundle
         |
         v
Browser loads app -> faster startup
```

---

## üîπ Code Example

* **JIT Compilation (Development)**

```bash
ng serve
```

* **AOT Compilation (Production)**

```bash
ng build --prod
# Angular 13+ default uses AOT
```

* **Enable/Force AOT in dev**

```bash
ng serve --aot
```

---

## üîπ Real-life Use Case

* **Gmail/Jira**

  * **AOT** is used in production ‚Üí faster page load, secure templates, fewer runtime errors.
* **Development environment**

  * **JIT** used ‚Üí faster rebuilds, easy debugging, hot reload.

## üîπ Summary

| Feature         | Development | Production   |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Compilation     | JIT         | AOT          |
| Bundle size     | Larger      | Smaller      |
| Startup speed   | Slower      | Faster       |
| Security        | Less secure | More secure  |
| Error detection | Runtime     | Compile-time |

---

‚úÖ **Takeaway:**

* Always use **AOT for production**.
* Use **JIT only during development**.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **JIT (Just-in-Time) Compilation Flow**

```
Source Code + Templates
        |
        v
Browser loads app
        |
        v
Angular Compiler runs in Browser (Runtime Compilation)
        |
        v
Templates & Components compiled
        |
        v
App executes
```

**Key Points:**

* Compilation happens **in the browser**.
* **Slower startup**, because browser compiles templates before running.
* Errors detected **at runtime**.
* Bundle size **larger** (templates included in JS).
* ‚úÖ Use: Development (`ng serve`)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compilation Flow**

```
Source Code + Templates
        |
        v
Angular Compiler runs at Build Time
        |
        v
Templates & Components pre-compiled
        |
        v
Optimized JavaScript bundle
        |
        v
Browser loads app -> Fast startup
```

**Key Points:**

* Compilation happens **before browser execution**.
* **Faster startup**, because templates are pre-compiled.
* Errors detected **at compile-time**.
* Bundle size **smaller**.
* ‚úÖ Use: Production (`ng build --prod`)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Bundle Size & Startup Comparison**

| Feature         | JIT (Dev)   | AOT (Prod)   |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Compilation     | Browser     | Build time   |
| Startup Time    | Slower      | Faster       |
| Bundle Size     | Larger      | Smaller      |

‚úÖ **Takeaway:**

* **JIT** ‚Üí Use during development for faster rebuilds and debugging.
* **AOT** ‚Üí Use for production to reduce startup time, detect errors early, and create smaller bundles.
